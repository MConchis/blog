    <h1>About</h1>
    <div class="post-contents">
      <p class="lede">Hi, I’m <strong>Haluk Diriker</strong>. For nearly two decades, I’ve been immersed in the world of video game development—nineteen years filled with design, scripting, building tools, and leading teams. I’ve worn many hats during my career, but the most significant ones were in game design and product management.</p>

      <p>I’ve worked across many genres and platforms: action, RPGs, racing, strategy, and mobile casual games. While open-world RPGs are my personal favorite, I’ve always enjoyed stretching into new styles and audiences, chasing challenges that spark my curiosity.</p>

      <p>This broad experience has given me a deep understanding of both the craft and the business—technical systems, creative vision, marketing, and strategy. What I love most is shaping an idea into a game that truly resonates with its audience, balancing imagination with the realities of the market.</p>

      <p>If you’re interested in game design, development, or just want to chat about the industry, I’d love to connect.
      </p>
